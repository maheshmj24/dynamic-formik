# Dynamic Formik
Render a form dynamically based on a schema.

### Form Schema
Form schema is available on the src/components/DynamicForm/formSchema.json file.
The schema can be changed accordingly. 
> *The app can be extended to fetch the schema json using an API so that schema is controlled separately by an Admin and is not part of the client side application.*

*The app Uses React and Formik*
